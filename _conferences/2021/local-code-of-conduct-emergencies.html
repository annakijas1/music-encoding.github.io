    <h3>Code of Conduct and emergencies</h3>    

    <p>The Music Encoding Conference values your attendance and is dedicated to providing a positive, harassment-free conference experience for everyone. We want MEC to be welcoming and supportive and we do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. See <a href="/conference/code-of-conduct.html" target="blank">MEC Code of Conduct</a> for more information.</p>
    
    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the MEC organizing committee may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, witness another participant being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer immediately. Event organizers will wear identifying buttons, and the registration desk will be staffed throughout the event. For less urgent matters, you may email conference2021 at music-encoding.org.</p>
    
    <p>As long as everyone is physically safe, conference staff will address the behavior with the participant. Conference staff will involve <a href="https://web.ua.es/en/vr-infraestructures/seguridad/service-of-security.html">university security</a> only as a last resort or at a victim’s request. </p>
    
    <p>If you do feel your safety is in jeopardy, or for any other emergency, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112">European emergency phone number <strong>112</strong></a>, available everywhere in the EU, free of charge. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any phone or simply ask a staff member.</p>        
    
    <h4>Medical attention</h4>
    <p>If you feel sick and need medical attention, please follow the same procedure by contacting an event organizer who will asist you in asking for medical assistance at the <a href="https://sri.ua.es/en/movilidad/exchanges/medical-assistance.html">the health unit at the Universidad de Alicante</a> or contacting the <a href="https://web.ua.es/en/vr-infraestructures/seguridad/service-of-security.html">university security service</a>.</p>
    
    <p>For an emergency, please phone <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112"><strong>112</strong></a>.</p>
