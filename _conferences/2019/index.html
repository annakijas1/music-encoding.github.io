<p style="margin-top:2em;">The Music Encoding Conference is the annual focal point for the Music Encoding Initiative community.</p>

<p>Music encoding is a critical component of the emerging fields of digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, and others. At the centre of these fields, the Music Encoding Conference has emerged as an important cross-disciplinary venue for theorists, musicologists, librarians, and technologists to meet and discuss new advances in their fields.</p>

<h4>MEI in Austria</h4>
  <p>The conference is organised jointly by the Division of Musicology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Mozart Institute of the Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg and the Department of Musicology of the University of Vienna.</p>
<h4>Bursaries for students</h4>
  <p>The conference awarded travel grants in a total of 4000 EUR to students with appropriate expertise. The bursaries partially cover the costs of registration, travel and accommodation.</p>
