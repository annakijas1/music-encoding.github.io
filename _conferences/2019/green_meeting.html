    <h2>Green Meeting</h2>
        <p>We are organizing this event in accordance with the guidelines of the <strong>Austrian Ecolabel for Green Meetings</strong> in order to contribute to resource conservation, climate protection, regional added value and awareness raising.</p>
        <p>
            This is how you can help us in this endeavour:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is possible, use environmentally compatible, public means of transportation to travel to the event location, or share a car.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can offset your CO2 emissions by means of compensation paymentsI, if you have to go by car, or if you travel by plane.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, choose an eco-labelled hotel (Austrian Eco-label, European Ecolabel, EMAS or others).</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make use of the environmentally benign offers of your hotel (change of towels and bedlinen only when needed or the like).</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn off all lights and electronic equipment (TV, air condition system, heating, computer, etc.) when you leave the hotel room for some time.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reusability = environmental protection: Give preference to drinks served by the glass, meals served in ceramic dishes, milk and sugar without individual packaging etc.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispose of your waste (PET, glass, paper, metal, batteries, etc.) via the separate collection systems provided at the hotel and at the event venue.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use public transportation or walk. We will provide you with a free ticket for public transport in Vienna for the days of the conference.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, use online registration and/or digital materials instead of paper copies and handouts.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your own writing utensils.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return your name badges at the information desk after the event.</span></li>
            </ul>
