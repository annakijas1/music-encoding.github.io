    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using and manipulating digital music information, the properties and behaviours of its encoding are of fundamental importance - be that for musicological study, music theory, production of digital editions, composition, performance, teaching and learning, cataloguing, symbolic music information retrieval and recommendation, or more general electronic presentation of musical material and associated narratives. The study of music encoding and its applications is therefore a critical foundation for the use of music information by scholars, librarians, publishers, and the wider music industry.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Music Encoding Conference has emerged as the foremost international forum where researchers and practitioners from across these diverse fields can meet and explore new developments in music encoding and its use. The Conference celebrates a multidisciplinary programme, combining the latest advances from established music encodings, novel technical proposals and encoding extensions, and the presentation or evaluation of new practical applications of music encoding (e.g. in academic study, libraries, editions, commercial products).</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-conference workshops provide an opportunity to quickly engage with best practice in the community. Newcomers are encouraged to submit to the main programme with articulations of the potential for music encoding in their work, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches within this context. Following the formal programme, on Saturday 1 June, an unconference session fosters collaboration in the community through the meeting of Interest Groups, and self-selected discussions on hot topics that emerge during the conference.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programme welcomes contributions from all those working on, or with, any music encoding. In addition, the Conference serves as a focus event for the Music Encoding Initiative community, with its annual community meeting scheduled the day following the main programme, on Saturday 1 June.</span></p>
