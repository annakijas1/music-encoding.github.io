<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music encoding is a critical component of the emerging fields of digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, and others. At the centre of these fields, the Music Encoding Conference has emerged as an important cross-disciplinary venue for theorists, musicologists, librarians, and technologists to meet and discuss new advances in their fields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Music Encoding Conference is the annual focal point for the Music Encoding Initiative community (</span><a href="http://music-encoding.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://music-encoding.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but members from all encoding and analysis communities are welcome to participate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, the annual conference will have a theme: “Encoding and Performance”. We welcome in particular submissions that theorize the relationship between music encoding and performance practice, describe experiments (failed or successful) in creating digital dynamic scores, propose ways of using encoded music for pedagogical purposes related to performance, or imagine future interconnections. The conference will be held at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, and therefore, we encourage presentations that include a performance component or demonstration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, other topics are welcome. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">music encoding for performance research and practice</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">music encoding as a theoretical approach for research</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">methodologies for encoding, music editing, description and analysis</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">rendering of symbolic music data in audio and graphical forms</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationships between symbolic music data, encoded text, and facsimile images</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">capture, interchange, and re-purposing of music data and metadata</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluation and control of quality of music data and metadata</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ontologies, authority files, and linked data in music encoding and description</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">music encoding and symbolic music information retrieval</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional topics relevant to music encoding, editing, and description</span></li>
</ul>
