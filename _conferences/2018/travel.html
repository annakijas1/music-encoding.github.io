  <h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>

  <dl class="list">
    <dt><a href="https://www.thehotelumd.com">The Hotel at the University of Maryland</a></dt>
    <dd>This brand new hotel is located just outside campus, a 20 minute walk from The Clarice Performing Arts Center (main venue).</dd>
    <dt>Staying downtown in Washington DC</dt>
    <dd>It is possible to stay downtown, but allow an hour door-to-door to get to and from the conference venue. We recommend the Chinatown area, with many hotel options, near all the major downtown sights, and on the Metro Green Line, which goes straight to College Park (see '<a href="../maps">Maps and Dining</a>').
    Please write to <a href="mailto:conference2018@music-encoding.org">conference2018@music-encoding.org</a> if you have any questions.</dd>

      approximately every ten minutes or less from the UM Shuttle stop on the east side of the station.
