  <h2>Program</h2>

  <p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, the Music Encoding Conference will be offered as a virtual event in 2020. Details are still being determined and will be shared in the next few weeks. The program schedule will be updated once we confirm virtual conference details with presenters.</p>
  
  <p>We are currently exploring the following formats for the virtual conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote presentations;</li> 
<li>Short session with papers and posters presented as 3-minute lightning talks;</li>
<li>Longer session for discussion of papers and posters via Slack channels;</li> 
<li>Spaces to facilitate community work (e.g. interest group meetings, spontaneous user groups);</li> 
<li>Moderated town hall;</li>  
<li>Workshops</li>
</ul>

<p>The Program Committee Chair will reach out to individuals with accepted papers and posters, first to ask if they are interested in participating in a virtual conference, and to identify next steps.</p>

  
  <p>The original program schedule can be found on <a href="/conference/2020/program-orig" target="_blank">this page</a>.
