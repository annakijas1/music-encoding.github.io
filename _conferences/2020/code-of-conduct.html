  <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>The Music Encoding Conference values your attendance and is dedicated to providing a positive, harassment-free conference experience for everyone. We want MEC to be welcoming and supportive and we do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>
<p>
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national or regional origin, body size, race, age, religion, or other marginalized characteristics are inappropriate. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for MEC. We ask that participants use discretion with photographs of others, recordings, and publicly sharing othersâ€™ ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the MEC organizing committee may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, witness another participant being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer immediately; see <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/sslbc2020/code-of-conduct/attendee-procedure/" target="blank">Attendee Procedure for Handling Harassment (language from the Tufts SSLBC)</a> for more detail about what would happen. Event organizers will wear identifying buttons, and the registration desk will be staffed throughout the event. For less urgent matters, you may email conference2020@music-encoding.org.
