<p><img src="/images/conference/2020/Duguid.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="headshot of Dr. Timothy Duguid" width="20%" align="left" style="margin:0px 15px"> <strong><a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/timduguid/" target="_blank">Dr. Timothy Duguid</a></strong> is a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Information Studies at the University of Glasgow. His current research interests lie in the intersection between digital humanities and historical musicology. In particular, he is focused on discoverability for digital research outputs in music, working on a virtual research environment called <a href="https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Music Scholarship Online</a> (MuSO) that will draw together published scholarship, digitized archival materials, and born-digital scholarship into a single online portal. Duguid is also working on a digital edition of the Scottish metrical psalms dating from 1564 to 1640. His work on Reformation history and early modern music resulted in the creation of a performing edition of the Wode Psalter, an early modern music collection, and he was associate editor for the digital project <a href="http://www.marianexile.div.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">“Letters in Exile: Documents from the Marian Exile”</a>.</p>

Her research interests include opera and political theory, music in the global early modern period and computational approaches in musicology. From 2015-2019 Joubert was principal investigator for a large-scale research project, <a href="http://operacanon.io/" target="_blank">Opera and the Musical Canon, 1750-1815</a>, funded by a SSHRC Insight Grant.  Current projects include a monograph entitled German Opera and the Politics of Sensation, 1750-1815, the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century volume of A Cultural History of Music co-edited with David R. M. Irving, and graph database visualization software to analyze operatic fame in the eighteenth century.</p>
