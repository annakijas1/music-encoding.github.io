  <h2><strong>This year's Music Encoding Conference will be run as a virtual event.</strong></h2>
  
  <p>There will be no charge for the virtual conference. Details for the virtual conference are still being determined and will be shared in the next few weeks. <strong>Please note that the MEC will resume as an in-person conference in succeeding years</strong>. Visit <a href="https://music-encoding.org/conference/2020/covid">this page</a> for information about cancellation of in-person conference due to COVID-19 virus.</p> 
  
  <p>We will refund all registration fees that have been paid. We ask that registered participants, including students who were awarded bursaries, send an email to conference2020@music-encoding.org indicating whether they would like to</p> 
  <ul>
<li>Receive a full reimbursement;</li>
<li>Receive a credit towards next year’s MEC;</li>
<li>Contribute your registration fee to a fund for student bursaries in succeeding years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the cancellation of the in-person conference, student bursaries will not be awarded this year.</p>
<p>We are currently exploring the following formats for the virtual conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote presentations;</li> 
<li>Short session with papers and posters presented as 3-minute lightning talks;</li>
<li>Longer session for discussion of papers and posters via Slack channels;</li> 
<li>Spaces to facilitate community work (e.g. interest group meetings, spontaneous user groups);</li> 
<li>Moderated town hall;</li>  
<li>Workshops</li>
</ul>

<p>The Program Committee Chair will reach out to individuals with accepted papers and posters to confirm interest in participating in a virtual conference and to identify next steps.</p>

<h2>About the Music Encoding Conference</h2>
  
<p style="margin-top:2em;">The Music Encoding Conference is the annual meeting of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) community and all who are interested in the digital representation of music.</p>

<p>Music encoding is a critical component for fields and areas of study including computational or digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, and digital libraries. This event brings together enthusiasts from various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, music scholars, and students and provides an opportunity for learning and engaging with and from each other.</p>

  <p>The conference was originally to be hosted at Tisch Library and Lilly Music Library of Tufts University on the <a href="https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/">Medford, MA campus</a>. It is co-sponsored with the Department of Music at Tufts, Digital Scholarship Group at Northeastern University Library, and MIT Digital Humanities.</p>
    
    <p>All attendees are expected to adhere to the conference <a href="https://music-encoding.org/conference/2020/code-of-conduct/" target="blank">Code of Conduct.</a></p>
