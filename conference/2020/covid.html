  <h3>Music Encoding Conference at Tufts University | 26 - 29 May 2020</h3>

  <div class="text-center"><span class="label"><strong>REGISTRATION IS SUSPENDED AS OF MARCH 12, 2020</strong></span></div>
   
<p style="margin-top:2em;">We have been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 (Corona Virus) and have decided to make the difficult decision of canceling the Music Encoding Conference scheduled for May 26-29, 2020 at Tufts University. As of March 11, 2020, the United States <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-announces-travel-europe-restricted-amid-coronavirus-threat/story?id=69543646">issued a travel ban</a> on some travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days due to the COVID-19 (Corona virus). This week Tufts University issued an announcement to its community that all classes will be held remotely, asking all students to return to their homes by March 16 and not return until after the end of the spring semester. The University also identified <a href="https://coronavirus.tufts.edu/3-10-2020-presidents-message/">its own restrictions on travel</a> for employees and students, including cancelling gatherings and events at least through April 30.</p>
 
<p>The health and safety of our entire community is important and while we have been looking forward to hosting this conference and welcoming so many colleagues and friends to Tufts University we must cancel the in-person conference.</p> 
 
<p>The Organizing, Program Committees, and MEI Board are exploring alternative options for a selection of the planned papers, presentations, workshops and meetings to be offered online and within the next week we will be in touch with everyone who has registered already or planned to attend the conference. We will make another announcement and post updates.</p>
