    <h2>Student Bursaries</h2>
    
    <strong>Please note that our initial pool of bursary funds have been allocated and applicants will be contacted soon. If additional funds become available they will be awarded.</strong>
        
    <p style="margin-top:2em;">We are happy to announce that the MEC will once again be offering bursaries for student participants to help defray conference travel and registration costs. Current graduate and undergraduate students are eligible. To apply, please indicate on the registration form that you would like to apply for a bursary, identify if you will receive financial support from your institution or elsewhere, and provide an estimate of your travel costs to attend the conference.</p> 

<p>Please note that bursaries may not cover the entire cost of attendance; the award amounts will depend on funding and on the number of applications received. We will fund each request at a maximum of 50%, up to $700.</p>  

<p>We will notify applicants within 14 business days after receiving submission of interest. </p>
