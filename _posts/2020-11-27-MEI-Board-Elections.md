Dear Community,

**TLTR:**

The 2020 MEI Board elections have started, if you are a registered member of MEI you should receive your voting tokens via email shortly. Before voting please see the [2020 MEI Board Election candidate statements](/community/mei-board/elections/2020/candidates)

**More info:**

The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is an open-source effort to define a system for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure. MEI brings together specialists from various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures.

The MEI Board manages the property and business of MEI. It promotes the development of MEI, oversees the activities of the MEI Technical Team, guides the development of the MEI conceptual model, Guidelines and schemata, and acts as a contact point for MEI-related activities. The Board consists of nine elected members and one member designated by each Host Institution. The Board will hold regular, virtual or in-person meetings. As schedules and funding permit, the Board will meet in person at least once per year.


We have a great set of 5 candidates to fill the 3 vacant positions on the MEI Board. You'll find the candidate statements at: https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board/elections/2020/candidates
