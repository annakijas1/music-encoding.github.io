Dear MEI Community, 

due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Germany and all over the world, we decided that the upcoming MEI Developer Workshop will be held online only. 

The workshop will be held in a combination of Zoom and Slack. We set up a [#workshops-dev2020 channel](https://music-encoding.slack.com/archives/C01CNDCP3CM) on Slack already, which you might want to join to receive further information. 

We would also like to have a family-friendly workshop, so we are moving it forward by one day.
Kick off will be on Wednesday November 11 at 3 pm CET with our first Zoom meeting. Saturday should remain free, unless we need more time.

The main objective of this meeting will be to bring the MEI schema and guidelines back together again in one repo and to prepare a new release.  

Hope to see many of you. 
Stay healthy!
Klaus Rettinghaus
