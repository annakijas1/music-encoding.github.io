Save the date! Vanderbilt University will hold a Music
Encoding workshop & hackathon in Nashville, TN on 24-27 October 2019. 

The workshop will introduce MEI to newcomers and offer workshops for advanced
users. Register (free) by October 17. The workshop will be led by members
of the Music Encoding Initiative Board and Technical Team.

Those new to MEI will learn how to use the Music Encoding Initiative for
research, teaching, electronic publishing, and management of digital
collections. Major topics will include: basic XML; MEI history and design
principles; tools for creating and editing MEI data and metadata; MEI-based
workflows; using Verovio.

Each day will include lectures, hands-on encoding practice, and
opportunities to address participant specific issues. Attendees are
encouraged to bring example material they would like to encode. No previous
experience with MEI or XML is required for this track, but an understanding
of music notation and other markup schemes, such as TEI and HTML, will be
helpful.

For software developers and advanced users interested in creating software
and documentation for authoring, editing, converting, querying, and
rendering encoded music data, the workshop will offer opportunities to
share ideas and tools with members of the Technical Team and other members
of the community.

We look forward to seeing you there!
