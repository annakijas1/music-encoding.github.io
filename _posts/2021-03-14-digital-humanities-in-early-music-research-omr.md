The Digital Humanities in Early Music Research series of the [Old Myths New Facts project](http://www.smnf.cz/en/) (Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences) presents its first workshop in 2021. The aim of this workshop is to teach participants how to use current software tools capable of optical music recognition (OMR) for processing plainchant manuscripts. Hands-on work is planned!

The workshop will consist of three sessions, two of them led by members of the Music Encoding Initiative Board, Ichiro Fujinaga and Martha E. Thomae (see the following program). **Reservation is required**, so if you wish to participate, please register here: [http://www.smnf.cz/en/news/Digital-Humanities-in-Early-Music-Research-2021-1-OMR-capable-chant-editors/](http://www.smnf.cz/en/news/Digital-Humanities-in-Early-Music-Research-2021-1-OMR-capable-chant-editors/).


**Session 1 (Talk): Large-scale OMR for neumes with Rodan**\
(Ichiro Fujinaga, McGill University)

*March 17th (Wednesday), 4 PM – 5 PM CET*

The overall goal of the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project is to develop a workflow for creating an infrastructure for a musical data discovery system. Here, we describe an online system for large-scale processing of neume music notation called “Rodan." The system converts the images of music manuscripts to a computer-readable format using optical music recognition (OMR) technologies.


**Session 2 (Workshop): Making Rodan work for you**\
(Martha Thomae, McGill University)

*March 18th (Thursday), 4 PM – 5:15 PM CET*

In this second session about SIMSSA (Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis), we will explore in more detail the technologies presented during the first session. We will see each of the OMR-related “jobs” available in “Rodan,” getting to know their settings, and how to interconnect these jobs to generate an MEI file which encodes the contents of a music manuscript. The goal of this workshop is for the audience to learn how to use these technologies for their own purposes.


**Session 3 (Workshop): Collaborative digital editions with OMMR4All**\
(Alexander Hartelt, Würzburg University, accompanied by Jan Hajič, Czech Academy of Sciences)

*March 19th (Friday), 4 PM – 6 PM CET*

OMMR4all is a web app for collaboratively creating digital facsimile editions of chant manuscripts in staff notation, with optical music recognition available as a part of the workflow. This workshop session is a hands-on tutorial that aims to teach participants how to efficiently use OMMR4all. We will walk through both manual and automated data entry workflows, show possibilities for collaboration, and demonstrate edition presentation features.
