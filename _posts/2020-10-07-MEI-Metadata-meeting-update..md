Dear friends of MEI metadata,

We would like to inform you that due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation we have decided to hold the working meeting on the topic of MEI metadata, which will take place from November 2 to 4, 2020, **only virtually**.

We have extended the registration deadline until 15 October 2020.

Further information on the schedule, topics and used technologies will follow soon.

Best wishes

Margrethe St√∏kken Bue and Kristina Richts<br/>
