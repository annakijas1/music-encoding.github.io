Dear friends of MEI metadata,

We hereby cordially invite you to the next MEI Metadata working meeting, which will take place from **2nd to 4th November 2020** at the **Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz**.

With this working meeting we will take up current metadata topics around MEI and plan to continue working on best practice recommendations for specific application scenarios of MEI metadata, such as work catalogues, source descriptions, etc. Since the meeting serves as an opportunity for professional exchange according MEI metadata, participants are welcome to suggest issues that should be discussed during the meeting. 

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we will decide at the end of September whether the meeting can take place physically or whether we switch to a virtual format or even to a hybrid meeting just in case of travel restrictions in the context of COVID-19.

**Registration:**

If you would like to participate in the workshop, please register by e-mail (to [kristina.richts@uni-paderborn.de](kristina.richts@uni-paderborn.de) and/or [Margrethe.Bue@nb.no](Margrethe.Bue@nb.no)) until September 30th. Please indicate if your participation will be physical or digital.

In case you would like to suggest issues for discussion, please let us know as soon as possible. If there are any questions concerning the meeting, we will be happy to answer them.

Best wishes and stay healthy,

Margrethe St√∏kken Bue and Kristina Richts<br/>
*Co-Chairs of the MEI Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group*
