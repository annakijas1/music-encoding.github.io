[Aruspix](https://www.aruspix.net) is a software application for the optical recognition, superimposition and collation of early music prints. With its optical recognition feature, Aruspix is a unique music scanning software for early music prints. It also has the ability to learns and improve itself dynamically as soon as a page is processed and corrected by the user. With its superimposition and collation features, Aruspix acts as a tool for music editors to compare early music editions and re-editions when compiling comprehensive critical modern editions. Aruspix uses MEI as its native file format. While orginally developed with editorial projects in mind, Aruspix is currently used in several projects that take a large-scale approach. It is also developed in close collaboration with the [Marenzio project](http://www.marenzio.org), an editorial project that aims at making available for the first time, and online, a complete critical edition of the secular music of Luca Marenzio (ca. 1553-1599).
