The project [Optical Music Recognition for Plainchant](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/omr/OMR_for_Plainchant/) investigates tools and techniques for optical music recognition (OMR) for monophonic plainchant from both printed and manuscript sources. The project uses MEI to capture and store the automatically-transcribed output of OMR tools for later processing and analysis.
