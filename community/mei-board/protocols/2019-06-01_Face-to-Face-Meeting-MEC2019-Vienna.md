# 2019-06-01 Face-to-Face Board Meeting at the MEC 2019 in Vienna

Present: Elsa De Luca, Norbert Dubowy, Ichiro Fujinaga, Andrew Hankinson, Johannes Kepper, Laurent Pugin, Eleanor Selfridge-Field, Benjamin W. Bohl
Absent: Kristina Richts

This year's face-to-face meeting of the *MEI Board* took place during the *Music Encoding Conference* at the *University of Vienna*. The below topics were discussed.

# Distribution of Tasks within the MEI Board

In the handover process of the role of the _Administrative Chair_ of the _MEI Board_ from Johannes Kepper to Andrew Hankinson both realised a benefit in distributing some tasks between them. With full support of the _MEI Board_ Johannes Kepper will act as treasurer of the _MEI Board_ and continue to see to the financial administration of MEI as he is familiar with both the processes and the contacts at the Mainz Academy. All financial transactions will be agreed upon by both, Andrew Hankinson and Johannes Kepper.
Benjamin W. Bohl will continue his work as secretary of the _MEI Board_.

# Porposal to accept Co-convenors for MEI Interest Groups

There has been the question from within the _MEI Community_ whether _MEI Interest Groups_ (IGs) can be convened by more than one person. The _MEI Board_ does not see this to contradict the  _MEI By-laws_, which are to be understood in the sense that there has to be (at least) one person acting as _administrative chair_ of an IG. This is to have someone in charge for coordinating the IG's activities and act as contact for the _MEI Community_ and the _MEI Board_ and in charge for the IG's annual report.

In particular this concerns the _Mensural IG_. With the full consent of the _MEI Board_ David Lewis will become _administrative co-chair_ of the _Mensural IG_, in order to reflect the IG's diversity both in international participation and of the subject matter itself.

# Additional Events in 2019

Last year first thoughts on hosting an MEI Technical Team Working Meeting in the United States of America in fall 2019 were made. There have been some discussions with potential hosts and potential funders. Discussions will be picked up by Johannes in order to be in the position to officially announce it.

Moreover a pre-conference workshop at this year's conference of the _American Musicological Society_ at Boston might be a good idea. Johannes will pursue theses plans. 

# Current and Future Prospects for Funding MEI

Currently MEI has three _Institutional Members_ that supply MEI with annual financial support: ZenMEM, tido, and ÖAW. More institutions shall be encouraged to support MEI by the members of the Board. Laurent Pugin will see to that MEI fulfills the obligations to theses members as defined in the _MEI By-Laws_.

Paderborn will add inkind funding by the means of Johannes Kepper's new job description, allowing him to dedicate 50% of his working time during the next 1.5 years to the needs of the _MEI Community_. The work done in this context shall be in close exchange with the _MEI Board_ and initially focus on picking up loose strains, e.g. in evolvement of the _MEI Guidelines_ or rendering the MEI website mobile-device-friendly.

In this context a proposal was made to the Board to add to the registration options for future _Music Encoding Conferences_ the option to support e.g. studentships. 

# Other Business

## Call for Hosting MEC 2021

The call for hosting MEC 2021 is to be sent out in due course. Concerning the past alteration of venues between Europe and the North Americas institutions from Europe should be especially encouraged.

## Program Chair for MEC 2020 in Boston

A Program Chair for next year's Music Encoding Conference should be determined at the next Board Meeting. All Board members should make up their minds concerning possible candidates.

# Next Board Meeting

Andrew Hankinson will set a date for the next Board meeting. The meeting will be held using a new platform.
