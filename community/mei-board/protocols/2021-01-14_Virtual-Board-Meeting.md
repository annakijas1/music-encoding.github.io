# 2021-01-14 Virtual MEI Board Meeting

Present: Johannes Kepper, Ichiro Fujinaga, Benjamin W. Bohl, Stefan MÃ¼nnich, Laurent Pugin, Perry Roland, Kristina Richts, Martha E. Thomae

Absent: Elsa De Luca

Minutes: Martha E. Thomae

## Administrative Chair & Technical Co-Chairs
Elsa De Luca was re-appointed as Administrative chair. The same was the case for the technical co-chairs: Johannes Kepper and Benjamin Bohl.

There is a pull request in the music-encoding website repository for implementing an automatic link checker to verify which links are broken in the website instead of having someone keeping an eye on it regularly.

## Update on MEC 2021
- The conference was postponed by two months (we have some submissions already). 
- Planning for a hybrid conference. The local organizers are looking into streaming ideas so that people who cannot travel---due to restrictions or difficulties getting travel funding---can still join.
  - wonder.me was proposed as an option for the interaction part of the conference (it could be considered as a "spatial zoom")
- There are two keynotes already.
- Looking into options for the proceedings:
  - Humanities Common
  - Bavarian State Library
  - More suggestions will be discussed in the next board meeting (maybe a journal?)
- We need to add a "news entry" for the delay of the conference so that people can find this information on the starting page.

## Workshops for People Interested in the Development of MEI and Poster Updating the Community about Recent Developer Work
- Martha will submit a one-page proposal for an ODD Workshop to be held during MEC. In this workshop, we will follow the tutorial ["Understanding ODD"](https://music-encoding.org/tutorials/understanding-odd.html)
- Johannes will prepare a poster explaining how the different components are connected in the new structure of the music-encoding repositories
- Both can count on the other board members to assist in these submissions

- Perry's suggestion: Martha and Stefan can be developer workshop coordinators. Preparing together the November developer workshop will give them a chance to learn more about MEI development.
- Ich: They could focus on organizational details, rather than teaching.

## Current Financial Situation
We will have a continuous income into the MEI pocket for the following three years.

## Conference (2022) and Developer Workshop (2021)
- Developer workshop could be held in Montreal (McGill University)
- Think about options for MEC 2022: Halifax? Victoria? Ottawa?

## ODD Meetings
The ODD meetings will still be held at the usual schedule:
- last Friday of odd months
- last Thursday of even months

## Next Board Meeting
April 15th, same time (5 pm GMT).
