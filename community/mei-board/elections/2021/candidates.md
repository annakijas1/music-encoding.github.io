previous postdoctoral fellowships at CESEM (05/2011–04/2013) and at the
University of Bristol (05/2013–08/2016). Currently, Elsa is Coordinator
of the *[Portuguese Early Music
Database](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpemdatabase.eu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGYC2yGsG4vsZWX0wW_d-rtlsxT3Q);* co-director
of the book series *Musicalia* *Antiquitatis &* *Medii* *Aevi*,
published by Brepols; and she served as Administrative Chair (2020–21)
and member of the Board of the *Music Encoding Initiative *(2019–21).
Elsa is also a board member of the [*Centre d\'Études de Paléographie
Musicale
(CEPM)*](https://sites.google.com/view/musicologie-medievale/CEPM?authuser=0),
and she had a crucial role during the first stage of the [*Cantus
Index*](http://cantusindex.org/acknowledgements), a research tool that
integrates eleven international chant databases and permits searches for
the chants for the mass and office.

Elsa holds a PhD in Historical Musicology (Università del Salento, 2011)
and a Piano Diploma (2002). Her research on notations in Iberian and
French manuscripts (10^th^ – 16^th^ cent.) and Visigothic musical
cryptography led to publications in major journals (*Early Music
History, Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies, MusikTheorie, Revue de
Musicologie, CSIC Anuario de Estudios Medievales* etc.). Elsa has
collaborated in research projects in Italy, France, Portugal, the UK,
and Canada.

#### Statement

I am honoured to be nominated as a candidate in the elections for the
MEI Board. I was introduced to MEI by my colleagues in the SIMSSA
project at McGill University and felt immediately enthusiastic about it.
Subsequently, I presented papers at MEC (2016, 2019), I contributed to
the development of the MEI Neumes Module (4.0) and the Guidelines (Ch.
6), and I co-authored an article on capturing early notations in MEI. I
co-edited the MEC Proceedings 2020, and I was recently nominated Team
Lead for the \"MEI and [DACT](http://dact-chant.ca/index.html)\" working
group. I served as MEI Board member (2019-21) and as Administrative
Chair (2020–21). I would very much welcome the opportunity to contribute
further to the vision and mission of MEI with my expertise as a music
palaeographer. The study of different styles of early notations has
equipped me with a deep understanding of the methodological challenge of
converting music into a machine-readable format that allows analysis and
accurate information retrieval. I am currently testing the
interoperability of the Neumes module to non-Western European early
notations. I also aim to promote MEI-related activities (workshops,
articles, conferences, etc.) among historical musicologists to bring
more varied expertise to the MEI community.


## Sophia Dörner

#### CV

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Library and Information Science and 
Musicology at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2020 with a thesis on research 
design and data practices in peer reviewed musicological publications. Since 
October 2019, I have been complementing these studies in the consecutive 
Master's programme in Information Science at the Berlin School of Library and 
Information Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. During my undergraduate 
studies, I worked with TEI and MEI in the context of a [digital letter edition 
of Ferruccio Busoni](https://www.busoni-nachlass.org/de/Index). Within the MEI 
community, I am a permanent member of the MEI Metadata and Cataloging Interest 
Group.

#### Statement

I feel truly honoured to have been nominated to stand as a candidate for the 
MEI Board election. Since I first came into contact with the MEI community, I 
have always encountered it as very welcoming and inclusive to all its members – 
be it novice or long-term members. I appreciate the diverse (professional) 
backgrounds of all the people involved in the community and the open-minded 
discussion and working environment that the community provides. If I was to be 
elected as a Board member, I would be delighted to share my personal expertise 
in the fields of musicology and information science to support the aims of the 
community in any way I can.


## Anna Plaksin

#### CV

Soon after graduating in Musicology at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universtät Mainz, 
I discovered the research field of Digital Humanities and Music Encoding. Working 
at various institutions like the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur
Mainz, Max Weber Stiftung Bonn and Birmingham City University I have been able 
to gather insights into different aspects of Digital Humanities. From 2015 to 2017 
and 2019 to 2021 I was involved in the long-term project [Corpus Musicae Otto 
manicae](https://music-encoding.org/projects/cmo.html), developing the source 
catalogue and the MEI representations of the music editions.
In 2020, I joined the project "Interpreting the Mensural Notation of Music: An 
Expert System Based on the Theory of Johannes Tinctoris" as a digital musicologist 
and developer. In the same year, I completed my dissertation at the Institute 
of Lingusitics and Literary Studies at Technical University of Darmstadt on 
"Models for the computational analysis of mensural music traditions", relying heavily 
on MEI encodings.
Currently (since 2021) I am back at my alma mater, working as a researcher at the 
Musicology Department at JGU Mainz and teach things like music encoding.

Alongside those activities I found already several opportunities for engagement 
in the MEI community. As a renaissance music researcher I am proud to be a 
member of the Mensural Interest Group for several years now. I am also happy to be 
involved in the development of [SibMEI](https://music-encoding.org/resources/tools.html#sibmei) 
and to serve as a member of the Program Comittee for MEC 2020 and
the upcoming MEC 2022.

#### Statement

I am honoured to be nominated as a candidate for the MEI Board. My first contact
with MEI was at the very first Music Encoding Conference 2013, and I fell in love 
with the field of interest and most notably the community. Serving on the Board, 
I would be excited to continue contributing to the community. One of my aims
is making MEI more accessible especially to students and others that are not 
involved yet but claim interest. Beside that, I am interested in increasing the
support of MEI for diverse use cases, regarding tools and analytical applications 
as well as opening up to different repertoires, like Ottoman music.


## Klaus Rettinghaus

#### CV

I received my diploma in astrophysics in 2007 at Technische Universität Berlin 
with a thesis on solar winds. I furthered my studies in musicology and 
Protestant theology at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, which I completed with a 
dissertation on the sacred works of Otto Nicolai in 2012 at the Technische 
Universität Berlin. After my PhD studies, I worked at Bach-Archiv Leipzig from 
2011 to 2020, where I was responsible for the structural and technical 
development of [Bach digital](https://www.bach-digital.de/). I am also a 
permanent lecturer in music history at Hochschule für Musik und Theater Felix 
Mendelssohn Bartholdy Leipzig. Since 2020, I have been working as a music 
engraving technologist at Enote GmbH in Berlin, leading the internal Verovio 
development group. Within the MEI community, I am a permanent member of the MEI 
technical team as well as various interest groups. My academic involvement also 
includes the position of Co-Convener of the [Digital Musicology Section of the 
German Society for Musicology (GfM)](https://www.musikforschung.de/fachgruppen/methodisch-thematische-fachgruppen/digitale-musikwissenschaft).

#### Statement

I am truly honored to have been nominated to stand as a candidate for the 
upcoming MEI Board election. It is a privilege to be part of this great 
community! If I was to be elected as a board member, it would be my pleasure to 
support the good work that is already going on in the community and devote my 
expertise to this aim in any way I can. Particularly focusing on the 
development of Verovio, SibMEI, and other tools build around MEI to serve the 
diverse needs of the community members.


## Margrethe Støkken Bue

#### CV

Margrethe Støkken Bue holds a master’s degree in musicology from the University 
of Oslo, and specialised in critical sheet music editing, music philology and 
Norwegian music history. She worked for nine years with sheet music archive, 
editing and production at the Music information Centre in Norway. Bue now works 
at the National Library of Norway, where her work includes work with MEI and 
TEI, reviewing digital solutions for notated music, and editing digital 
publications of music related sources, and will from 2022 start using MerMEId 
at the National Library. A special research interest is performing arts as 
text, and she is currently running a small project together with a dance 
researcher. She manages RISM and RILM in Norway, and is administrative co-chair 
of MEI Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group. 

#### Statement

My first meeting with MEI was through work with MerMEId and TEI. I found that 
MEI is a very important project that covers several aspects within digital 
musicology, and a project that needs to be kept going. Through interest and 
luck, I got the opportunity to work with MEI tutorials, guidelines, metadata 
and MerMEId, and I find this work very rewarding.
I am humbled by the nomination for the board, and being a board member would 
give me the chance to give more back to the MEI community. The board's most 
important work is to facilitate the development of MEI in all areas, making 
sure that the project and community stays strong and relevant. To ensure future 
interest and engagement from old and new members, we need to keep today's 
perfect combination of high technical and academic level with a welcoming and 
including environment.
