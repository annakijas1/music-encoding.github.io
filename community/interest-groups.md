# Interest groups

An Interest Group (IG) is composed of any number of members of the MEI community with an interest in a certain music encoding topic or problem. In order to form a new IG, a proposal shall be made to the Board, containing the group’s name, goals, and a list of founding members.  

## Mensural Interest Group

**Administrative Chair: [Giuliano Di Bacco](mailto:gdibacco@indiana.edu)** The aim of the Interest Group is to discuss the use of MEI for the encoding of musical repertories in mensural notation (late 13th century to about 1600); to recommend additions and emendations to future versions of the MEI schema and guidelines; to discuss the use, adaptation or creation of tools for editorial and analytical purposes. These goals may be extended. The group's work is conducted through a dedicated mailing list, and an annual meeting is held at the Music Encoding Conference. All members of the MEI community with an interest in mensural notation are welcome to join the IG by subscribing to the mailing list: [https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-mensural-ig](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-mensural-ig)  

## Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group

**Administrative Co-Chairs: [Margrethe Bue](mailto:Margrethe.Bue@nb.no), [Kristina Richts](mailto:kristina.richts@uni-paderborn.de)** The aims of the Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group is to discuss the use of MEI for the encoding of musical metadata; to make recommendations regarding the development of the element; to promote the sharing of and collaboration on tools for projects concerned with MEI metadata such as cataloging projects. 'Cataloging' in this context may include a wide range of projects such as thematic catalogues ('Werkverzeichnisse'), library catalogs, and other descriptions of musical works or sources. The group is open to all members of the MEI community. Members enroll simply by subscribing to the group's mailing list: [https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-catalog-ig](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-catalog-ig)  

## Neume Interest Group

**Administrative Chair: [Ichiro Fujinaga](mailto:ichiro.fujinag@mcgill.ca)** The aim of the Neume Interest Group is to discuss the use of MEI for the encoding of neume notation, including adiastematic and diastematic neumes. Any members of the MEI community with an interest in neume notation are welcome to join the group by subscribing to the mailing list: [https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-neumes-ig](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-neumes-ig), where most of the discussions take place.
