# Technical team

The Technical Team consists of interested developers and two Board-appointed Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs act as administrative chairs of the Technical Team, e.g. calling meetings and coordinating development efforts. They also have administrative privileges for the MEI repositories. The MEI Technical Team holds regular virtual and in-person meetings, maintains the MEI repository on GitHub ([https://github.com/music-encoding](https://github.com/music-encoding)), prepares new releases of MEI by reviewing and implementing revisions and features requested by the community, and supports the wider MEI community with their technical expertise.
